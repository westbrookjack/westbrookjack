# 👋 Hi, I'm Jack Westbrook

I'm a math-turned-crypto learner focused on post-quantum cryptography, Rust systems programming, and applied algebra.  
Currently working on a structured plan toward a Spring 2026 PQC engineering role.

- 🔐 Building toy cryptographic tools in Rust and C++
- 📘 Learning from NIST PQC standards and foundational math (lattices, error-correcting codes)
- 🛠️ Projects: [`pqc-journey`](https://github.com/westbrookjack/pqc-journey), [`caesar_cipher`](https://github.com/westbrookjack/pqc-journey/tree/main/caesar_cipher)
- 📫 Email: jackswestbrook@gmail.com
