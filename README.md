# 👋 Hi, I’m Jack Westbrook

🎓 I'm a mathematics graduate with a deep interest in arithmetic geometry, algebraic number theory, and commutative algebra.  
🧮 I've conducted research across several areas of pure mathematics — from Newton polygons and Hilbert–Kunz multiplicities to explicit constructions in hyperbolic geometry.  
🛠 I also explore cryptographic systems and protocols through side projects in Rust and modern C++.

## 🔬 Current Research Projects

- 🟣 **Hilbert–Kunz Multiplicities**  
  Studying variation in multiplicities of Segre products and connections to tight closure phenomena (UMich REU 2024).

- 🟢 **Newton Polygons & Vector Fields**  
  Characterizing extremal degrees in bilinear inequalities via combinatorial and geometric techniques (UW–Madison REU 2022).

- 🔵 **Solutions to _The Rising Sea_**  
  Detailed writeups and independent solutions to exercises in *The Rising Sea* by Ravi Vakil.

## 🔐 Side Projects in Cryptography

- 🧱 **Rust & C++ Crypto Implementations**  
  Toy implementations of AES, MACs, modular arithmetic, and secure message formats.

- 🗂 **PQC Learning Roadmap**  
  An organized exploration of post-quantum cryptography standards, including lattice-based systems and symmetric-key primitives.
