# 👋 Hi, I’m Jack Westbrook

🎓 I'm a math undergraduate passionate about post-quantum cryptography, lattice-based crypto, and secure systems.  
🔬 I’ve worked on commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and Macaulay2 tooling.  
🦀 Currently learning Rust and modern C++ to build secure and efficient crypto libraries.  

## 🔧 Current Projects
- 🔐 `pqc-journey`: My ongoing cryptography engineering roadmap
- 🔢 `segrePresentation`: A Macaulay2 package for working with Segre products
- 📗 `vakil-solutions`: My detailed writeups for *The Rising Sea* by Ravi Vakil
